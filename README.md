# General
Some useful scripts simplifying bureaucracy, especially when living in Munich, Germany.

# termin.py
Small tool to show availability of appointments in different Departments of Munich.

Available departments are:
- Ausländerbehörde (foreign nationals affairs, residence permits, work visas etc.)
- Bürgerbüro (civil affairs, residence registration etc.)
- Führerscheinstelle (driver license and motor vehicles affairs)


Please note the script **does not perform appointment booking**, it just tells you current status, so you may run it with cron and\or add some custom notifier.
